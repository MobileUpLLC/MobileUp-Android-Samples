    <string name="image_carousel_description_cats">Oh, what adorable little creatures these kitties are! 🐱✨ Tiny fluffy bundles of coziness that skillfully rule our hearts with just one glance. They’re as graceful as panthers yet as silly as little fur clouds. Kitties love to jump, play, purr, and give us sly looks while we’re busy with our tasks. They also adore curling up on the coziest blanket and pretending it’s their kingdom. Their tiny paws hold the power of the world, and their eyes—an entire universe of love. 💕🐾</string>
